        <h1>Weather site Plan</h1>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
        The client would like a web based weather app created. The purpose of the site is to give<br>
        current weather conditions in 3 different ways.  The initial landing page will give the<br>
        weather for the current location based on the Geocoding information given by the browser.<br>
        The second is weather for 3 specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the<br>
        third is weather for any location determined by a search string.
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
        Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.  Most will be students.  Access to the site will be split<br>
        between mobile devices and laptops.
        </p>
        <h4>Audience Goals:</h4>
        <p>
        College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather<br>
        conditions for their current location as they head off to class or study. They are also often<br>
        far from their homes so the ability to quickly get the conditions for a specific location is<br>
        important as well.  The third goal deals with planning for travels...the ability to get weather<br>
        conditions for any location will help with last minute packing for road trips.
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li><b>Name:</b> Joe Cool</li>
        <li><b>Occupation:</b> student</li>
        <li><b>Age:</b> undetermined</li>
        <li><b>Interest:</b> Traveling, seeing new things</li>
        <li><b>Motivation:</b> Joe is not into planning.  His last minute scrambling, whether it<br>
            is getting to class in the morning or heading out on his latest adventure, has<br>
            left him unprepared for weather conditions many times (He is tired of<br>
            sleeping in the rain and snow).  He would like to be more prepared...without<br>
            having to put much effort into it...or planning.
        <li><b>Environment:</b>: Joe is comfortable using laptops and Mobile devices, he will<br>
        </ul>
            most often be found on a smart phone however.  Many of the places he<br>
            frequents do not have great signal…he is often dealing with 3G speeds</li>

    <li><b>Age:</b> 18</li>
        <li><b>Interest:</b> Giving advice, Psychology</li>
        <li><b>Motivation:</b> Lucy is a no nonsense young lady who likes to help those<br>
            around her.  She wants easy access to the weather conditions for many<br>
            locations so that she can always be prepared to offer some unsolicited<br>
            advice to her peers.</li>
        <li><b>Environment:</b>: Lucy has a smart phone that she uses to keep her eye on her<br>
            social media ‘friends’.  She is usually not very far from her trusty laptop<br>
            however. Most of her time online is spent either on the University network<br>
            or the apartment broadband.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>
        All weather pages should include Location name, temperature, high, low, current weather<br>
        descriptor, precipitation, and wind on small, and hourly temps should be added on larger<br>
        screens. (See provided weather data file for more details)

                using the Geolocation API of the browser.  This information should be passed to the<br>
                WeatherUnderground API  (<a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/"> https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/ </a>) to<br> retrieve the current conditions.</li>
            <li><b>Franklin, Greenville, Springfield:</b>weather for each specific location. The weather<br>
                for The Franklin and Greenville pages should be pulled from a local JSON file that will be provided.</li>
            <li><b>Search:</b>Begins with only a search box, characters entered will cause a list of<br>
                suggested matches to appear.  Selected location will pull up the weather. The search<br>
                term from the field should be sent to the <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=autocomplete-api&MR=1">WeatherUnderground autocomplete API</a><br>(https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=autocomplete-<br>api&MR=1), and the results used to pull the current conditions for the selected location.</li>
